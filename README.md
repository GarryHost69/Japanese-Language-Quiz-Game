A Japanese Language Quiz Game made using Javascript and p5.js 
Only 2 Scripts (Hiragana and Katakana) are implemented in a Flash card Quiz Game Format. 
I wanted to Practice creating and Manipulating JSON files and objects in Javascript, therefore made this silly Game. 
I could've implemented Kanji script as well but so far my Knowledge of Kanji sounds and readings is as good as Null ergo only hiragana and katakana.
Both Hiragana and Katakana JSON files were made by me so there might be some questioning as to how they are not "Proper JSON files", since I'm still learning Javascript, however I checked the entire file after creating it on JsonFormatter which showed no errors and it works perfectly fine in the program so I guess it's okay.
